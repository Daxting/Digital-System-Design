### Summary
- **Introduction:**
  - Implements DIP Switch, Push Button, Keyboard, Screen, LED lights, and a seven-segment display.

- **Control and Interaction:**
  - Manages difficulty, wind speed, and weapon selection through switches, buttons, and keyboard.

- **Visual Feedback:**
  - LED lights provide feedback on hitting/missing the dog, success/failure, and game events.

- **Display Information:**
  - Seven-segment display shows current level, throw power, wind speed, remaining throws, and the dog's life.

- **Game Screen:**
  - Displays the game on a 480x640 pixel screen, with each grid sized at 60x40 pixels.

- **Game Dynamics:**
  - Cat aims to defeat a dog with 9 life pointswithin 5 throws, using different weapons.
  - Level 1 is straightforward, Level 2 introduces wind speed, cat movement, bomb mechanics, and obstacles.

- **Map Design:**
  - Specifies cat and weapon sizes, initial positions.
  - In Level 2, obstacles change height, and the dog moves invisibly during intervals.

- **Throwing Mechanism:**
  - Weapons thrown at a 45-degree angle, influenced by throw power and wind speed.

- **Project Outcome:**
  - Successfully integrates hardware components for an engaging game.

- **Portfolio Integration:**
  - The project is included in the portfolio, showcasing practical skills in digital system design.

- **Learning Highlights:**
  - Gained experience in hardware integration, game dynamics, and problem-solving.

- **Submission Requirements:**
  - Report with source code, FPGA demo, and work distribution among group members.
